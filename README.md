# ClickO RN Mobile App

A full-featured React Native application for instantly connecting users to local service providers ("agents") across 25+ categories. Built with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/) for rapid development and beautiful UI, [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) Python microservices (one per category) for scalable backend, and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (with PostGIS) for geospatial queries.
